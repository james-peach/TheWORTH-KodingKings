We worked diligently on the website that you are viewing. We raced against time to try to make sure that we provided you with at least a decent website from us as novice coders. We hope you enjoy judging our website as much as we enjoyed building it. We are very grateful to you for having given us the chance to enter in this contest. 

Responsiveness was something that we struggled with considering how many pictures we used on our website. However, even after dealing with all those problems, we feel as if the product will be very satisfactory to you.  

The W.O.R.T.H. is a mentoring group headed by Malissa Glenn. She does a lot of work in the community of Jackson, but provides information about their meetings primarily through social media, so we thought it would be a good idea to create a website for her. Enjoy! 

Thank you,
